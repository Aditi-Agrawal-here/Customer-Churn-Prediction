# Customer-Churn-Prediction
An end-to-end Customer Churn Prediction project built using Machine Learning in Python. This project analyzes real-world bank customer data to predict whether a customer is likely to churn. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Models are evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to identify the best-performing approach.

The project demonstrates how predictive analytics can help businesses improve customer retention and make data-driven decisions.
